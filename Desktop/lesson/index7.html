            The asset pipeline offers Rails developers the opportunity to deliver CSS, JavaScript,
            and image files to the browser more optimally. Depending on the type of file, this can be
            through compression or a file name fingerprint. Different CSS files are combined into one
            big file. The fingerprinting enables the browser and any proxy in between to optimally
            cache the data so the browser can load these files more quickly on subsequent visits.
